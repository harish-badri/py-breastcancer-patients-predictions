# Logistic Regression Training Project - Breast Cancer Patients

# What is the objective of this project?
In this project, we will see how to train a logistic regression model. This is intended as an introduction to logistic regression. However, we will not go through the mathematical intuition of the model.

We will be working with the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains some very detailed measurements of cells. Along with each observation of measurements, we have the diagnosis of the cell (malignant or not). Our goal is to train a model that will be able to predict whether or not a given cell is malignant given only its measurements.

# What is the data in this project?
In this project, we work with dataset freely available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) which contains some very detailed measurements of cells.
